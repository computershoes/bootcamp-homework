### Step 1:
- Approximate date/time of attack: 2020-02-23 14:30:00
- It took approximately 9 hours for the systems to recover from the attack.

### Step 2:


### Step 3:
- Approximate time of brute force attack: 02/21/2020 08:00:00 to 02/21/2020 15:00:00
- Average failed log on attempts: 13
- Failed log on attempts threshold for potential brute force attack : 20
