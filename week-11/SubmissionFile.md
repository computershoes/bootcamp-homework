## Unit 11 Submission File: Network Security Homework 

### Part 1: Review Questions 

#### Security Control Types

The concept of defense in depth can be broken down into three different security control types. Identify the security control type of each set  of defense tactics.

1. Walls, bollards, fences, guard dogs, cameras, and lighting are what type of security control?

    Answer: Physical controls

2. Security awareness programs, BYOD policies, and ethical hiring practices are what type of security control?

    Answer: Administrative controls

3. Encryption, biometric fingerprint readers, firewalls, endpoint security, and intrusion detection systems are what type of security control?

    Answer: Technical controls

#### Intrusion Detection and Attack indicators

1. What's the difference between an IDS and an IPS?

    Answer: An IDS is passive. It stores logs and alerts for future analysis. An IPS is active. It can respond to suspected malicious traffic by blocking packets from reaching their destination.

2. What's the difference between an Indicator of Attack and an Indicator of Compromise?

   Answer: An indicator of attack happens in realtime and indicates that an attack may currently be in progress. An indicator of compromise happens after an attack and indicates that a breach has occured. 

#### The Cyber Kill Chain

Name each of the seven stages for the Cyber Kill chain and provide a brief example of each.

1. Stage 1: Reconnaissance - Attackers gather as much information as possible in order to identify vulnerabilities. Examples are login credentials, hardware information, and PII.

2. Stage 2: Weaponization - Attackers use information harvested in Stage 1 to create weapon(s) that target the system's vulnerabilities. This is usually malware designed to serve the attacker's obective.

3. Stage 3: Delivery - Attackers deliver the weapons through various methods that often involve an element of social engineering. An example of this is sending phishing emails with links or attachments that install malware when opened.

4. Stage 4: Exploitation - Once into the system, the malware is triggered to exploit targeted weaknesses and execute the malicious code.

5. Stage 5: Installation - The attack vector is installed and persistence is established.

6. Stage 6: Command and Control - With remote access to the target system, the attacker can now perform tasks to maintain control. This can include changing permissions or creating more points of entry.

7. Stage 7: Actions on Objective - The attacker carries out their original objective. Examples are data encryption for ransom, data exfiltration, or data destruction.


#### Snort Rule Analysis

Use the Snort rule to answer the following questions:

Snort Rule #1

```bash
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 5800:5820 (msg:"ET SCAN Potential VNC Scan 5800-5820"; flags:S,12; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 5, seconds 60; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats.net/2002910; classtype:attempted-recon; sid:2002910; rev:5; metadata:created_at 2010_07_30, updated_at 2010_07_30;)
```

1. Break down the Sort Rule header and explain what is happening.

   Answer: An alert is sent if incoming TCP traffic from the external network is detected on ports 5800-5820.

2. What stage of the Cyber Kill Chain does this alert violate?

   Answer: Stage 1: Reconnaissance

3. What kind of attack is indicated?

   Answer: An attacker may be scanning to find any vulnerable VNC ports in order to gain remote access to the system.

Snort Rule #2

```bash
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ET POLICY PE EXE or DLL Windows file download HTTP"; flow:established,to_client; flowbits:isnotset,ET.http.binary; flowbits:isnotset,ET.INFO.WindowsUpdate; file_data; content:"MZ"; within:2; byte_jump:4,58,relative,little; content:"PE|00 00|"; distance:-64; within:4; flowbits:set,ET.http.binary; metadata: former_category POLICY; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats.net/bin/view/Main/2018959; classtype:policy-violation; sid:2018959; rev:4; metadata:created_at 2014_08_19, updated_at 2017_02_01;)
```

1. Break down the Sort Rule header and explain what is happening.

   Answer: An alert is sent if a PE EXE or DLL file is donwloaded over http.

2. What layer of the Defense in Depth model does this alert violate?

   Answer: This alert violates a policy which falls under the Administrative control layer of the DiD model.

3. What kind of attack is indicated?

   Answer: An attacker may be attempting do deliver malware to the system.

Snort Rule #3

- Your turn! Write a Snort rule that alerts when traffic is detected inbound on port 4444 to the local network on any port. Be sure to include the `msg` in the Rule Option.

    Answer: `alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET 4444 -> $HOME_NET any (msg: "ET Potential Trojan")`

### Part 2: "Drop Zone" Lab

#### Log into the Azure `firewalld` machine

Log in using the following credentials:

- Username: `sysadmin`
- Password: `cybersecurity`

#### Uninstall `ufw`

Before getting started, you should verify that you do not have any instances of `ufw` running. This will avoid conflicts with your `firewalld` service. This also ensures that `firewalld` will be your default firewall.

- Run the command that removes any running instance of `ufw`.

    ```bash
    $ sudo apt remove ufw
    ```

#### Enable and start `firewalld`

By default, these service should be running. If not, then run the following commands:

- Run the commands that enable and start `firewalld` upon boots and reboots.

    ```bash
    $ sudo systemctl start firewalld
    $ sudo systemctl enable firewalld
    ```

  Note: This will ensure that `firewalld` remains active after each reboot.

#### Confirm that the service is running.

- Run the command that checks whether or not the `firewalld` service is up and running.

    ```bash
    $ sudo systemctl status firewalld
    ```


#### List all firewall rules currently configured.

Next, lists all currently configured firewall rules. This will give you a good idea of what's currently configured and save you time in the long run by not doing double work.

- Run the command that lists all currently configured firewall rules:

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
    ```

- Take note of what Zones and settings are configured. You many need to remove unneeded services and settings.

#### List all supported service types that can be enabled.

- Run the command that lists all currently supported services to see if the service you need is available

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --get-services
    ```

- We can see that the `Home` and `Drop` Zones are created by default.


#### Zone Views

- Run the command that lists all currently configured zones.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --get-zones
    ```

- We can see that the `Public` and `Drop` Zones are created by default. Therefore, we will need to create Zones for `Web`, `Sales`, and `Mail`.

#### Create Zones for `Web`, `Sales` and `Mail`.

- Run the commands that creates Web, Sales and Mail zones.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone=Web
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone=Sales
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone=Mail
    ```

#### Set the zones to their designated interfaces:

- Run the commands that sets your `eth` interfaces to your zones.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent -zone=public --change-interface=eth0
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent -zone=web --change-interface=eth1
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent -zone=sales --change-interface=eth2
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent -zone=mail --change-interface=eth3
    ```

#### Add services to the active zones:

- Run the commands that add services to the **public** zone, the **web** zone, the **sales** zone, and the **mail** zone.

- Public:

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent -zone=public --add-service=http
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent -zone=public --add-service=https
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent -zone=public --add-service=smtp
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent -zone=public --add-service=pop3
    ```

- Web:

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent -zone=public --add-service=http
    ```

- Sales

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent -zone=public --add-service=https
    ```

- Mail

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent -zone=public --add-service=smtp
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent -zone=public --add-service=pop3
    ```

- What is the status of `http`, `https`, `smtp` and `pop3`?

#### Add your adversaries to the Drop Zone.

- Run the command that will add all current and any future blacklisted IPs to the Drop Zone.

     ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=drop --add-source=10.208.56.23
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=drop --add-source=135.95.103.76
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=drop --add-source=76.34.169.118
    ```

#### Make rules permanent then reload them:

It's good practice to ensure that your `firewalld` installation remains nailed up and retains its services across reboots. This ensure that the network remains secured after unplanned outages such as power failures.

- Run the command that reloads the `firewalld` configurations and writes it to memory

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
    ```

#### View active Zones

Now, we'll want to provide truncated listings of all currently **active** zones. This a good time to verify your zone settings.

- Run the command that displays all zone services.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
    ```


#### Block an IP address

- Use a rich-rule that blocks the IP address `138.138.0.3`.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="138.138.0.3" reject'
    ```

#### Block Ping/ICMP Requests

Harden your network against `ping` scans by blocking `icmp ehco` replies.

- Run the command that blocks `pings` and `icmp` requests in your `public` zone.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-icmp-block=echo-request
    ```

#### Rule Check

Now that you've set up your brand new `firewalld` installation, it's time to verify that all of the settings have taken effect.

- Run the command that lists all  of the rule settings. Do one command at a time for each zone.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=drop --list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=web --list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=sales --list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=mail --list-all
    ```

- Are all of our rules in place? If not, then go back and make the necessary modifications before checking again.


Congratulations! You have successfully configured and deployed a fully comprehensive `firewalld` installation.
